An Android Game made as a project for 2D game development class at Edmonds Community College. This game was written in java 
using the libgdx tools for creating games for multiple platforms at the same time. It runs on both Windows and on any Android device.
On Windows it utilizes the keyboard as its controls; On android it usues the touch screen and the accelerometer to read tilt motions
which are used to navigate the player through the game. In the game you controlled a small ball which you avigated through both
top-down and side scrolling levels as you made your way to the end of each level.
